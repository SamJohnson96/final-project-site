The Extra Trees classifier is one of the 5 machine learning classifiers used to classify the sentiment of newly scraped articles. It is a model that is based on using decision trees and the only one out of the five. Similar to the Naive Bayes classifier and Linear Perceptron, it is trained using a Tfidf Vectorizer. A Tfidf Vectorizer takes raw textual files from the GDELT training set and creates a feature matrix which new articles are then classified against. After rounds of testing an accuracy of 77.15% was able to be achieved through cross-validation.

To test this classifier, input some textual content into the field below. When you are ready to test, click on the 'Test API' button and it hit the API and return a classification of whether the text is positive or negative based on what was in the input field.
