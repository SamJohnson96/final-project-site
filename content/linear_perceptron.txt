The Linear Perceptron classifier is one of the 5 machine learning classifiers used to classify the sentiment of newly scraped articles. It is one of the simplest models implemented for this pipeline. Similar to the Naive Bayes classifier and Extra Tree classifier it is trained using a Tfidf Vectorizer. A Tfidf Vectorizer takes raw textual files from the GDELT training set and creates a feature matrix which new articles are then classified against. After rounds of testing an accuracy of 76.94% was able to be achieved through cross-validation. While there was a hope this could be improved through tuning the algorithms hyperparameters, I wasn't able to improve the cross-validation score.

To test this classifier, input some textual content into the field below. When you are ready to test, click on the 'Test API' button and it hit the API and return a classification of whether the text is positive or negative based on what was in the input field.
