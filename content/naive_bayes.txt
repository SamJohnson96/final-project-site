The Naive Bayes classifier is one of the 5 machine learning classifiers used to classify the sentiment of newly scraped articles. The Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier was implemented using the classifier provided by Scikit-learn. Their documentation describes it as:

'MultinomialNB implements the naive Bayes algorithm for multinomially distributed data, and is one of the two classic naive Bayes variants used in text classification'.

After rounds of testing and cross-validation, the classifier was trained using a TfidfVectorizer which converted the raw training GDELT files into a matrix of TF-IDF features. This yielded better results in testing over using a count vectorizer or a word2vec implementation with a cross-validation accuracy of 77.88%.

To test this classifier, input some textual content into the field below. When you are ready to test, click on the 'Test API' button and it hit the API and return a classification of whether the text is positive or negative based on what was in the input field.
